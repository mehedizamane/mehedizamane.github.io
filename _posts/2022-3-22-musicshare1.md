1. 风神125-交工乐队
   
In the village of my birth,
A traveler returned to earth.
What he saw and what he felt,
Are now in this song so heartfelt.

The harshness of the city life,
Left the people with great strife.
Abandoned and left to despair,
Their sorrow so heavy to bear.

But a mother's comfort is there,
Simple hope for life beyond compare.
No matter what, you must live on,
And find the strength to carry on.
But through it all, we must endure,
