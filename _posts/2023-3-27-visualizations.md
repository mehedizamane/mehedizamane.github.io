To facilitate the teaching of a certain undergraduate class, I created some visualizations for several basic machine learning algorithms, including K-Means clustering, e.g. These visualizations help students to better understand the underlying concepts of these algorithms and how they work in practice.

I believe that visualizations are a powerful tool for teaching and can help students to grasp complex concepts more easily. I am happy to share these visualizations with anyone who may find them useful.

Thank you for your attention.
