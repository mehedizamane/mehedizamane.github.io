Hi, my name is S M Mehedi Zaman. I am a recent graduate from Islamic University of Technology ([IUT](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/)); My major was EEE. Currently, I am collaborating as a **Remote** Research Intern at the AI Institute of University of South Carolina ([AIISC](https://aiisc.ai/)), where we are working on exciting new breakthroughs in NLP domains!

Latest News:
- Our recent paper on AI generated text detection has just been accepted to EMNLP 2023! (See it here)
- Data Efficency. Focus on self-supervised & semi-supervised & weak-supervised learning or learning with synthesized data.
- Statitical ML. Focus on statitical modelling, generative models (diffusion-based models), trust-worthy learning (interpretability and robustness) and graph learning, ideally, with theoretical basis or guarantee.
