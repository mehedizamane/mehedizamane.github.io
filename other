# Music
I am also an amateur drummer and singer. I have been playing drum since I was 12. I love playing bands. I was the drummer in 3 bands(2 in China during my college life and 1 in US). I deeply love my friends. 
If there is anything that can save my life, it must be rock. Rock you. Here are some performance
